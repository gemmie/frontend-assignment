## Solution for Frontend Assignment

I created an application using React with Typescript. App consists of one page, and a number of components. It is a minimalistic view, that allows peaceful and clear article browsing. Articles can be filtered by category and sorted by date of publishing.

### Ways to improve the solution

- find a better way for sorting articles
- possibly break Article component down to smaller components
- unify styling
